The materials, substances,\nor components transformed are raw materials that are products of agriculture, forestry, fishing,\nmining or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing activities. Substantial alteration,\nrenovation or reconstruction of goods is generally considered to be manufacturing.\nUnits engaged in manufacturing are often described as plants, factories or mills and charac-\nteristically use power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment. However, units that\ntransform materials or substances into new products by hand or in the worker\u2019s home and those\nengaged in selling to the general public of products made on the same premises from which they\nare sold, such as bakeries and custom tailors, are also included in this section. Manufacturing units\nmay process materials or may contract with other units to process their materials for them. Both\ntypes of units are included in manufacturing.\nThe output of a manufacturing process may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilization\nor consumption, or it may be semi-finished in the sense that it is to become an input for further\nmanufacturing. For example, the output of alumina refining is the input used in the primary pro-\nduction of aluminium; primary aluminium is the input to aluminium wire drawing; and aluminium\nwire is the input for the manufacture of fabricated wire products.\nManufacture of specialized components and parts of, and accessories and attachments to,\nmachinery and equipment is, as a general rule, classified in the same class as the manufacture of\nthe machinery and equipment for which the parts and accessories are intended. Manufacture of\nunspecialized components and parts of machinery and equipment, e.g. engines, pistons, electric\nmotors, electrical assemblies, valves, gears, roller bearings, is classified in the appropriate class of\nmanufacturing, without regard to the machinery and equipment in which these items may be\nincluded. However, making specialized components and accessories by moulding or extruding\nplastics materials is included in class 2220.\nAssembly of the component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing. This\nincludes the assembly of manufactured products from either self-produced or purchased com-\nponents.\nThe recovery of waste, i.e. the processing of waste into secondary raw materials is classified in class\n3830 (Materials recovery). While this may involve physical or chemical transformations, this is not\nconsidered to be a part of manufacturing. The primary purpose of these activities is considered\nto be the treatment or processing of waste and they are therefore classified in Section E (Water\nsupply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities). However, the manufacture of\nnew final products (as opposed to secondary raw materials) is classified in manufacturing, even\nif these processes use waste as an input. For example, the production of silver from film waste is\nconsidered to be a manufacturing process.\nSpecialized maintenance and repair of industrial, commercial and similar machinery and equip-\nment is, in general, classified in division 33 (Repair, maintenance and installation of machinery\nand equipment). However, the repair of computers and personal and household goods is classi-\nfied in division 95 (Repair of computers and personal and household goods), while the repair of\nmotor vehicles is classified in division 45 (Wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles\nand motorcycles).\nThe installation of machinery and equipment, when carried out as a specialized activity, is classi-\nfied in 3320.\nRemark: The boundaries of manufacturing and the other sectors of the classification system can\nbe somewhat blurry. As a general rule, the activities in the manufacturing section involve the\ntransformation of materials into new products. Their output is a new product. However, the defini-\ntion of what constitutes a new product can be somewhat subjective. As clarification, the following\nactivities are considered manufacturing in ISIC:\n\u2014 milk pasteurizing and bottling (see 1050)\n\u2014 fresh fish processing (oyster shucking, fish filleting), not done on a fishing boat (see\n1020)\n\u2014 printing and related activities (see 1811, 1812)\n\u2014 ready-mixed concrete production (see 2395)\n\u2014 leather converting (see 1511)\n\u2014 wood preserving (see 1610)\n\u2014 electroplating, plating, metal heat treating, and polishing (see 2592)\n\u2014 rebuilding or remanufacturing of machinery (e.g. automobile engines, see 2910)\n\u2014 tyre retreading (see 2211)\nConversely, there are activities that, although sometimes involving transformation processes, are\nclassified in other sections of ISIC; in other words, they are not classified as manufacturing. They\ninclude:\n\u2014 logging, classified in section A (Agriculture, forestry and fishing);\n\u2014 beneficiating of agricultural products, classified in section A (Agriculture, forestry and\nfishing);\n\u2014 beneficiating of ores and other minerals, classified in section B (Mining and quarrying);\n\u2014 construction of structures and fabricating operations performed at the site of construc-\ntion, classified in section F (Construction);\n\u2014 activities of breaking bulk and redistribution in smaller lots, including packaging, repack-\naging or bottling of products, such as liquors or chemicals; sorting of scrap; mixing of\npaints to customers\u2019 order; and cutting of metals to customers\u2019 order, producing a modi-\nfied version of the same product, are classified to section G (Wholesale and retail trade;\nrepair of motor vehicles and motorcycles).", "subsections": {"10 Manufacture of food products": "This division includes the processing of the products of agriculture, forestry and fishing into food for humans or animals, and includes the production of various intermediate products that are not directly food products.

Production can be carried out for own account, as well as for third parties, as in custom slaughtering. Some activities are considered manufacturing (for example, those performed in bakeries, pastry shops, and prepared meat shops etc. which sell their own production) even though there is retail sale of the products in the producers\u2019 own shop. However, where the processing is minimal and does not lead to a real transformation, the unit is classified to Wholesale and retail trade (section G).
